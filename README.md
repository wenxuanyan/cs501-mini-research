# LetsEat
LetsEat app is design for lonely BU students to dine out with other lonely BU students.<br>
We will match users based on their majors and preference to types of cuisine. Users will choose to match or unmatch other users (swipe left or right) just like tinder. <br>
Users are able to chat with others after they match and the app will suggest restaurants for them to dine. We are planning to use three apis for our app.<br>
<h>This is Team Blue mini research deliverables
  <p> We used three APIs: Yelp, twitter and Sendbird.
       
<b>Yelp</b>
    <img   style = "height:600px; width: 400px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
       src="Yelp.png" ><br>
    <p> you enter types of food and then location, it will pop up the restaurants near you. Also there is a button to click and lead you to google map for exact address.This APIs is aim to restaurants search in app.
    
<pre> 

<b>Twitter</b>
<img   style = "height:600px; width: 400px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
       src="twitter.png" ><br>
       <p> you enter first user name and it will search the accounts he/she/they follow. Same to second user. And you enter both, it will find the mutual account they follow. This APIs aim for find same interests between users in order to match them.

<pre>

<b>SendBird</b>
<img   style = "height:600px; width: 400px;border: solid 2px; border-radius: 50px;" 
       src="Sendbird.png" ><br>
       <p> You create account first, then you can create a channel with other users or joined channel to chat with others. This APIs/SDK enable the chat function in app.
